1)BASIC CONCEPTS -> WHY VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM 

advantages:
-Allows developers to work simultaneously
-Does not allow overwriting each otherâ€™s changes. 
-Maintains a history of every version.

VCS is either  ditributed/centralzed 
centralized ->located at one place 

centarlized VCS - SVN/perforce/Accurev etc -> But the major drawback of CVCS is its single
point of failure, i.e.,in case of  failure of the central server the entire team holds until server is back RUNNING.

Distributed Version control system(DVCS) and GIT

why GIT:

-open source software
-save time - lightning fast
-work offline - everyone has complete repository at their local .Not dependent on central server all the time to work on a file.
-undo mistakes 
-unique branching capabilities ->cheap and easy to merge. 
-fast and rapid
-uses very less space - git gc saves around 50% of disk usage of the complete repo and should be used when we have very less disk space.
-there is GITHUB for hosting your GIT repositories (1 GB space for free)


2)Env Setup/Installations of GIT
git --version

GETTING STARTED:

Create Operation:
-create a new user 
git config --global user.name "SRIKANT KUMAR"
git config --global user.mail "SRIKUMAR@amdocs.com"
git config --list


3)You can use GIT for 2 common scenarios:
-if you have existing code base on a local machine and want to track under Git ->git init 
for untrack this project u can simply delete .git folder
git status
.gitignore

 working , staging area  and .git directory

tracking files:
git add file name (git add. for every changes)
git commit -m "Initial commit"
both command combined: git commit -am "Initial commit"
git log 

->git reset for removing all files to working directory and as untracked files


4)if you have existing project remotely that u want to start developing -> git clone <url> <where to clone>
 cd /c/Users/srikumar/GIT_DEMO/Cloned-Repo
git clone https://github.com/srikantkumar/GIT_DEMO_GITHUB_REPO.git .

$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/srikantkumar/GIT_DEMO_GITHUB_REPO.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/srikantkumar/GIT_DEMO_GITHUB_REPO.git (push)

$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/Nov_release
  remotes/origin/master

make some changes just like we did in local
working directory is modified now
commit to make it in staging area

PUSH these changes remotely so that others can have access to these:
first make a pull always inorder to make your repo up to date 
git pull origin master ->it pulls any changes which have been made by other developers since we pulled  it last time .
git push origin master 

LIFE CYCLE of git operations:
-clone a git repo as working copy ->git clone <clone-url> <clone dest>
-modify by editing/adding files ->git add filename or git add . or git add *.html etc
-if required update by refreshing other developers changes by -> git pull origin master
origin is the name of repo and master is the branch.
-review the changes before commit ->git commit -m "proper messages"
-commit your changes and if everything seems fine , push your changes to the repo ->git push


MANAGING branches:
create a branch -> git branch  brach_name ->git push -u origin branch_name
switch between branches ->git checkout branch_name
switch and create with same command ->git checkout -b branch_name
list branches -git branch (current branch) , git branch -a



merge two branches -> git branch --merged ->all branched which have been merged
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git branch --merged  -> *master (new branch do not popup there)
git merge new_branch_name
git push origin master

if the branch is no longer required after merge:
Delete a branch locally- git branch -d branch_name
Delete a branch on remote -> git push origin  --delete branch_name

be on destination branch (master) and run git merge new_branch_name 


TAG creation:
show tags: git tag
create tags : git tag -a 11-Nov-Codebase  -m "Nov_11"
view tags: git show Nov_11
checkout to a particular tag: git  checkout Nov_11
delete tags - git tag -d Nov_11 (local delete)
              git push origin :Nov_11


USEFUL COMMANDS:
.git
gitignore
git diff



ONLINE repositories
-create a GITHUB repo
push operation
pull operation
